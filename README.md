#  GPS-Based Lap Tracker

Live GPS lap tracking and visualization system using a **Neo M8N GPS module** + **Python**.

---

##  Requirements

- **Hardware**
  - Neo M8N GPS Module  
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)

- **Python Libraries**
  - `serialpy`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `numpy`

## Receiving and Parsing NMEA data 

- The microcontroller being used to receive and parse gps data is an STM32F446RE
- USART1 was used to receive NMEA data and USART2 was used to print the latitudes and longitudes to the serial port.

| STM Pin| GPS Pin | Function |
| --- | --- |------|

- **gpsParse(char *strParse)**
  -This function parses incoming NMEA GPS sentences ($GPGGA, $GPGLL, or $GPRMC) to extract latitude and longitude data. It converts the NMEA-format coordinates into  decimal degrees using nmeaToDecimal() and sends the formatted result over UART.

   How it works:

   Checks which NMEA sentence type is received (GGA, GLL, or RMC).

   -Uses sscanf to extract latitude, longitude, and directional info.
   -Converts the raw NMEA latitude/longitude to standard decimal degrees.
   -Formats the result as a comma-separated string.
   -Transmits the final coordinates over UART2.

- **nmeaToDecimal(float coordinate)**

  - Converts a GPS coordinate from NMEA format (ddmm.mmmm) to standard decimal degrees (dd.dddddd).

##  Python Live Tracking Features

- **GPS Data Acquisition**  
  High-accuracy GPS data is received using the [NeoGPS](https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoGPS) library.

- **Serial Communication**  
  Data is transmitted from the microcontroller and read via `serialpy` on the host PC.

- **Real-Time Data Visualization**  
  GPS coordinates are plotted using `matplotlib`. The first lap defines the base track layout.

- **Lap Detection and Timing**  
  A lap is considered complete when the current GPS location returns within a **0.00003Â°** threshold of the start point.

- **Live Tracking (Lap 2+)**  
  From the second lap onward, a moving location marker is shown. The base track remains constant.

- **RPM Trail Visualization**  
  RPM is simulated and shown as a color-coded trail:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: < 2000 RPM  
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: 2000â€“4000 RPM  
  - ðŸ”´ Red: > 4000 RPM

##  Core Functions

### `save_first_lap_trajectory()`
- Saves latitude/longitude of the first lap into a `.npy` file.
- Returns the array for use in offset boundary drawing.

### `draw_virtual_start_line(lat, lon)`
- Creates a vertical **lime green** start/finish line using the first GPS coordinate.
- Only drawn once at initialization.

### `update_lap_one()`
- Called during lap 1.
- Simulates RPM and assigns a trail color.
- Plots GPS path in real-time.
- Updates blue current-location marker.
- Displays point count.

### `update_plot_lap_two_onwards()`
- Called from lap 2 onwards.
- Applies RPM color logic.
- Loads saved first lap and draws offset track boundaries.
- Updates GPS trail and live position.
- Refreshes lap counter and timer.

### `check_lap_completion(lat, lon)`
- Continuously checks proximity to the start line.
- Triggers when:
  - Enough points are recorded.
  - Start point is reached again.
- Actions:
  - Increments lap count.
  - Updates lap time.
  - Saves first lap (if applicable).
  - Clears old data to prep for the next lap.

### **Main Loop Logic**
Continuously:
- Reads GPS data via Arduino serial (e.g., `COM3`).
- Parses GPS (lat, lon).
- Initializes start line.
- Appends valid coordinates.
- Calls:
  - `update_lap_one()` during lap 1.
  - `update_plot_lap_two_onwards()` for lap 2+.
- Handles cleanup on keyboard interrupt.

##  Usage

** Hardware Setup**

- Connect your **Neo M8N GPS module** to your **microcontroller** (e.g., Arduino).
- Ensure the GPS module has a clear view of the sky for optimal signal.
- Upload your Arduino sketch that outputs GPS NMEA sentences via serial.
